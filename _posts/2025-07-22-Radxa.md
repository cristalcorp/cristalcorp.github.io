# Radxa ZERO 3W

## Install a distro

The doc can be found [here](https://docs.radxa.com/en/zero/zero3).
The [resources](https://docs.radxa.com/en/zero/zero3/getting-started/download).
The Radxa ZERO 3 [GitHub](https://github.com/radxa-build/radxa-zero3).


The GitHub release [page](https://github.com/radxa-build/radxa-zero3/releases/tag/b6).


radxa-zero3_debian_bullseye_xfce_b6.img.xz is tested and boots ok. Using the sd card

radxa-zero3_debian_bullseye_cli_b6.img.xz download fine.

From the community we get that [page](https://forum.radxa.com/t/guide-arch-linux-for-single-board-computers/26042) about using Arch on it.

### The installation

On this first test, I used radxa-zero3_debian_bullseye_xfce_b6.img.xz image.

```bash
unxz radxa-zero3_debian_bullseye_xfce_b6.img.xz
dd bs=4M if=/home/cristal/Downloads/radxa-zero3_debian_bullseye_xfce_b6.img of=/dev/sda conv=fsync oflag=direct status=progress
```

After these steps you should have that on your SD card :
