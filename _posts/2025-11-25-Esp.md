ESP are cool. Let s bend them to our needs.

# ESP

## LoRa

### Heltec v3

#### Linux setup

First you ll need Python and Pip installed. You ll figure it out.  
Then install esptool

```bash
yay -S esptool
```

Clone the repo :
```bash
git clone git@github.com:meshtastic/firmware.git
cd firmware
git switch tags/v2.5.19.f9876cf # which is the latest tag at the moment, adapt
```

#### Da build
in order to build and especially upload, we ll use Platformio. I tried to install it system wide, it did compile the firmware, but during the upload process, it tried to pip-install some modules and failed. Therefore I would recommend the following :


```bash
# Setting up the env
uv venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install platformio

# Now We can play with pio
pio system info
pio pkg list

# List all available envs
pio project config | grep env: [ | grep heltec ]

# Teh build
pio run -e heltec-v3

# Teh upload
pio run -e heltec-v3 -t upload --upload-port /dev/ttyUSB0
```

#### Bonus
Change the name on the splash screen.  
Edit the following file : src/graphics/Screen.cpp.
Around line 168, look for 'const char *title = "meshtastic.org";' and replace it by whatever name you want.  
Side note :  
The line before is : "#ifdef USERPREFS_SPLASH_TITLE", so I am pretty sure there is better way to make a custom splashscreen
